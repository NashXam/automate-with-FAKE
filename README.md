# Build Automation and CI with Xamarin

#### Get Started
- [Build all the things with FAKE](http://jonathanpeppers.com/Blog/build-all-the-things!-with-fake)
- [Using TeamCity with Xamarin](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/ci/teamcity/)


#### Recommended Approach
1. Create Xamarin Project
2. Automate Build with a script
3. Push code to GitHub
4. Install TeamCity
5. Configure TC project with source control
6. Configure TC to execute build scripts

Not code.
